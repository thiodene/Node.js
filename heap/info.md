In computer science, a heap is a specialized tree-based data structure which is essentially an almost complete tree 
that satisfies the heap property: in a max heap, for any given node C, if P is a parent node of C, 
then the key (the value) of P is greater than or equal to the key of C. In a min heap, 
the key of P is less than or equal to the key of C. 
The node at the "top" of the heap (with no parents) is called the root node.
