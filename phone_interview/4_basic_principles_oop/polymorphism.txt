# Definition:
The polymorphism is a core concept of an object-oriented paradigm that provides a way to perform a single action in different 
forms. It provides an ability to call the same method on different JavaScript objects. 
As JavaScript is not a type-safe language, we can pass any type of data members with the methods.

# Example: Let's see an example where a child class object invokes the parent class method.

class A  
  {  
     display()  
    {  
      document.writeln("A is invoked");  
    }  
  }  
class B extends A  
  {  
  }  
var b=new B();  
b.display();
