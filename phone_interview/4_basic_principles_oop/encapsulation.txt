# Definition:
Encapsulation refers to enclosing all the functionalities of an object within that object 
so that the object’s internal workings (its methods and properties) are hidden from the rest of the application. 
This allows us to abstract or localize specific set of functionalities on objects.

We create objects with methods, properties, and attributes. 
When we make them bundled inside an object it’s known as encapsulation. 
When these methods and attributes are abstracted from other objects, this is known as abstraction.

# Example:

var prop1 = "one"; //private
this.prop2= "two" //public
var tc = new test();
var tp1 =tc.prop1; //undefined: because prop1 is private;
